<p>Courses such as COMP110, just like organizations, services, and products, can be improved through intentional iteration on their design in order to <em>create more value</em> for its stakeholders. This practice is generally known as <em>continuous improvement</em>.</p>
<p>What is <em>creating value</em>? This idea can manifest in many ways, such as: serving unmet needs, reframing problems as opportunities, identifying authentic demand, testing novel ideas, leveraging underutilized resources, extending existing solutions, and so on.</p>
<p>In a course, the stakeholders are typically:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Students Enrolled</li>
<li>Instructional Staff</li>
<li>Academic Institution</li>
<li>Societal Workforce</li>
</ol>
<p>In this open-ended exercise, you will reflect on your personal experiences and observations in COMP110 and brainstorm modifications to the course that <em>create value</em> beyond its current design.</p>
<p>From your brainstormed ideas, you will consider them in the context of the anonymized course survey data submitted by you and your peers earlier in the semester. You will identify which one of your ideas <em>does not</em> or is <em>least likely</em> to have data to support or refute your idea and suggest how we might collect that data in the future. Then you will identify which one of your ideas <em>does have</em> data to analyze and carry out an analysis of your most promising idea.</p>
<p>Your will then perform an analysis of the data to explore the degree to which the data supports your idea. It is OK and expected that many ideas will not have conclusive support in the data and may even be rejected by the data. This is OK!</p>
<p>Your project will need to satisfy many specifications, so before you begin programming be sure to read this project’s write-up and the provided template notebook in full.</p>
<h2 id="rubric">Rubric</h2>
<p>Part 1. Creative Ideation (15pts)</p>
<ul>
<li>Good - 5 pts - One brainstormed idea identifies value created for a specific stakeholder group.</li>
<li>Better - 10 pts - Three brainstormed ideas which each identify value created for a specific stakeholder group.</li>
<li>Best - 15 pts - Five brainstormed ideas which each identify value created for a specific stakeholder group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Part 2. Identifying Missing Data (10pts)</p>
<ul>
<li>Good - 5 pts - Identifies an idea that does not have applicable data to support or is unlikely to have enough data to support.</li>
<li>Better - 10 pts - Additionally is able to suggest a plausible and realistic way to collect data to support the idea in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Part 3. Choosing Your Analysis (10pts)</p>
<ul>
<li>Good - 5 pts - Chooses an idea that has data from the survey which could be analyzed in support of it.</li>
<li>Better - 10 pts - Articulates reason for choosing this idea to analyze over others based on its potential to create value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Part 4. Analysis (50pts) - Each rubric item is independent of the others.</p>
<ul>
<li>5pts - Each code cell in your analysis is preceded by a markdown cell explaining what you are attempting to do. Walk us through your thought process.</li>
<li>5pts - The code cells are executed and the notebook has saved outputs of code cells submitted.</li>
<li>5pts - Import and make use of <code>read_csv_rows</code> function</li>
<li>5pts - Import and make use of <code>head</code> function</li>
<li>5pts - Import and make use of <code>columnar</code> function</li>
<li>5pts - Import and make use of <code>select</code> function</li>
<li>5pts - Import and make use of <code>count</code> function</li>
<li>5pts - Define and use at least one helper function of your own design. One idea is a function that filters some data based on some criteria. For example, all values in a column that are greater than some threshold.</li>
<li>5pts - Carries out a logical analysis given the stated idea being analyzed.</li>
<li>5pts - Produces a chart or visualization of the relevant data being analyzed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Part 5. Conclusion (15pts)</p>
<ul>
<li>Good - 5 pts - Summarizes findings of analysis and the degree to which it supports, refutes, or is inconclusive regarding the idea put forth.</li>
<li>Better - 10 pts - Puts forth potential costs, downsides, or trade-offs of adopting the idea.</li>
<li>Best - 15 pts - Identifies extensions or refinements to this idea to consider as future work.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just the baseline requirements. In order to completely analyze the idea you choose to explore, more intermediate steps may be necessary!</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>You will get the data needed by “pulling” from the course workspace repository. Steps to do this:</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>Be sure you are in your course workspace. Open the file explorer and you should see your work for the course. If you do not, open your course workspace through File &gt; Open Recent.</li>
<li>Open the <em>Source Control View</em> by clicking the 3-node (circles) graph (connected by lines) icon in your sidebar or opening the command palatte and searching for <em>Source Control</em>.</li>
<li>Click the Ellipses in the Source Control pane and select “Pull, Push” from the drop-down menu, then select “Pull from…” A box will appear and you should select either “origin” or “upstream”, but not “backup”. This will begin the pulling process from the course repository. It should silently succeed. (If you are on macOS and do not see anything in source control anymore, it may be because of a macOS update. You can typically resolve this by opening a new Terminal, typing the command <code>xcode-select --install</code>, pressing enter and following its instructions. You will also need to restart VSCode after doing this.)</li>
<li>Return to the File Explorer pane and open the <code>data</code> directory. You should see it now contains the csv file with the survey results called <code>survey.csv</code>.</li>
<li>In your workspace’s <code>exercises</code> directory, you will see a folder named <code>ex08</code>. Inside that folder, there is a file named <code>analysis.ipynb</code> for this assignment.</li>
<li>Additionally, create another file <code>data_utils.py</code> and copy in your functions from the previous exercise’s file with the same name!</li>

<h2 id="some-notes-before-you-begin">Some notes before you begin</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some of the survey questions were optional, so there will not be a data value for every column in every row. This is expected. Instead the value will just be the empty <code>str</code> or <code>""</code>.</li>
<li>When you read in the CSV as a <code>list[dict[str, str]]</code> with your <code>read_csv_rows</code> function, every value is interpreted as a <code>str</code>, including numerical ones! Analysis on columns that include likert data (ratings 1-7), for example, will need to be converted to a numeric type for numeric analysis.</li>
</ul>
